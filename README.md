resetrdio
=========

## Information

A python script that unsubscribes a user from all playlists.

I found that having a lot of playlists impacted performance of the rdio App and the playlist interface doesn't cater well to sorting through a lengthy ammount of playlists. So in order to minimize this I created a script to reset the number of playlists I was subscribed to and get a fresh start with rdio.
